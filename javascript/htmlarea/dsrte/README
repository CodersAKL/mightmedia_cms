DAMN SMALL RICH TEXT EDITOR v0.2.4
By Roi Avidan <roi@avidansoft.com>
--------------------------------------

Installation:
Basically add jquery.js, dsrte.js (or dsrte.pack.js), dsrte.css and a call to $dsrte_instance->getScript() to your HEAD tag.
For a working example, check out demo.php's source.

Requirements:
PHP 5.0+
JavaScript enabled browser (preferably FF, but IE will do I guess)
Latest jQuery (NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE! GET IT FROM http://jquery.com)

Recommendations:
It is recommended that you use the packed/minified versions of the code, for maximum performance and minimum bandwidth consumption.
If you can, enable GZIP compression on your web server to minimize bandwidth even more.

Writing Plugins:
I have provided 2 sample plugins (BBCode and MySpan) and you may also take a look at the built-in commands plugins (i.e.link, color, etc.).
Basically, you should create at least 2 files in the plugins/ directory (one is .php and the other .js).
The system will automatically load the .php class, and call the relevant methods to initialize it and it's JS counterpart.

Credits:
The packed/minified versions have been compressed using Dean Edwards' EXCELLENT packer (can be found at: http://dean.edwards.name/packer/)
Also includes a minified version of AjaxFileUpload plugin for jQuery, taken from: http://www.phpletter.com/DOWNLOAD/
